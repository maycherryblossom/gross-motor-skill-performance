    """Cross Entropy Loss.

    Support two kinds of labels and their corresponding loss type. It's worth
    mentioning that loss type will be detected by the shape of ``cls_score``
    and ``label``.
    1) Hard label: This label is an integer array and all of the elements are
        in the range [0, num_classes - 1]. This label's shape should be
        ``cls_score``'s shape with the `num_classes` dimension removed.
    2) Soft label(probablity distribution over classes): This label is a
        probability distribution and all of the elements are in the range
        [0, 1]. This label's shape must be the same as ``cls_score``. For now,
        only 2-dim soft label is supported.

    Args:
        loss_weight (float): Factor scalar multiplied on the loss.
            Default: 1.0.
        class_weight (list[float] | None): Loss weight for each class. If set
            as None, use the same weight 1 for all classes. Only applies
            to CrossEntropyLoss and BCELossWithLogits (should not be set when
            using other losses). Default: None.
